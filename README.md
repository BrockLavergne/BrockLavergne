Hi, I'm Brock.  A Full Stack Software Developer and Professional Project Scheduler.  With over 10 years in the Industrial field utilizing tracking/management software, facing a task head on and providing a viable solution is what I've always taken pride in. The further in to my career I got, the more I realized that working with software systems and truly understanding them was the very thing that interest me the most. I attended Tech Elevators Software Development Bootcamp, spending over 800 hours learning complex programming and the ins-and-outs of developing the very software systems that interested me so much in my previous profession.   My biggest strength is my capability to learn. Having an adaptable mindset and a willingness to learn things from a different angle are key components to tackling any problem you face. When I first began a career in Software Development, I spent most of my time picking away at problems that I could easily solve, just to see if there was a different way to approach and solve the problem. The more I found success, the more I grew to love this ever evolving field.
